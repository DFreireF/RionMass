# RionMASS
Toolkit for mass measurements of ringed ions, with time-of-flight and/or Schottky cavity detectors.
It implements the Convolutional Matrix Method (CMM) with polynomial fit (so far) and performs the mass calibration routine to obtain the masses of the ions whose revolution frequency we measured.

Still under development!
